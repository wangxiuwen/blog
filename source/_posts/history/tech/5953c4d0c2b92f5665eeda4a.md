 [code]ssh  -qTfnN -D 8080 root@qianrushi.org[/code] 
[code]ssh  -qTfnN -D 7070 username@remote_server
All the added options are for a ssh  session that’s used for tunneling.
-q :- be very quite, we are  acting only as a tunnel.
-T :- Do not allocate a pseudo tty, we are  only acting a tunnel.
-f :- move the ssh process to background, as  we don’t want to interact with this ssh session directly.
-N :- Do  not execute remote command.
-n :- redirect standard input to  /dev/null.
In addition on a slow line you can gain performance by  enabling compression with the -C option.[/code]
