ansible 添加用户:

	---
	
	- name: ansible playbook
	  hosts: all
	  remote_user: root
	  become: yes
	  tasks:
		- name: 添加用户
		  user:
			name: test
			state: present
			groups: wheel,sudo
			append: yes
		  tags:
			- user
			

测试:

	ansible-playbook play.yml -t user
	
查看:

	ansible all -a 'groups test'
	
如果想删除用户，可以将 state 设置成 `absent`， 如果想同时删除目录，则设置 remove 为 `yes`
