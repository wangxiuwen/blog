I was using those commands for VirtualBox in rc.local, and I ran into the same problem. I don't if this is the right way to do this, but it works for me.I created /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.localhost.startup.plist containing the code below. It runs the rc.local script once at start up.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>             <string>local.localhost.startup</string>
    <key>Disabled</key>          <false/>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>         <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>         <false/>
    <key>LaunchOnlyOnce</key>    <true/>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/etc/rc.local</string>
        </array>
</dict>
</plist>

launchctl  load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.localhost.startup
