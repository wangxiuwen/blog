$ supervisorctl
http://localhost:9001 refused connection

You should run supervisorctl with -c as well. From the documentation (my emphasis):

The Supervisor configuration file is conventionally named  supervisord.conf. It is used by both supervisord and supervisorctl. If either application is started without the -c option (the option which is used to tell the application the configuration filename explicitly), the application will look for a file named supervisord.conf within the following locations, in the specified order. It will use the first file it finds.

$CWD/supervisord.conf
$CWD/etc/supervisord.conf
/etc/supervisord.conf
